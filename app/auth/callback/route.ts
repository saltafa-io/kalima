  // 5. âœ… **CRITICAL FIX:** Redirect the user directly to their final destination.
  // Instead of redirecting back to the `/auth` page (which can cause client-side
  // race conditions and bounce-tracking issues), we send the user straight to the `/dashboard`.
  // This is a more robust and faster approach because the server already knows
  // the user is authenticated at this point. New users will be handled by logic on the dashboard.
  const finalRedirectUrl = new URL('/dashboard', siteUrl);

  // 6. Return a response that tells the user's browser to navigate to the final destination.
