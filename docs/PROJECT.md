## Kalima — Project README

Last updated: 2025-10-08

This document is the single source-of-truth for the Kalima project. It describes the architecture, important files, environment variables, deployment notes, current known issues, recommended next steps, and includes a changelog template (date/versioned) that we will update as work progresses.

## Purpose

Kalima is an AI-powered platform for learning and practicing spoken Arabic. The goal is to provide personalized learning through AI voice agents that simulate real conversation partners and tutors — not just pronunciation feedback. Kalima helps learners gain confidence speaking, understand everyday spoken Arabic (Modern Standard and dialects), and practice naturally until they feel comfortable conversing with others.

Users sign in with OAuth (Supabase + Google), enroll by providing a profile (name, email, level, learning goals) and then interact with voice-first lessons and AI agents. The project will combine speech-to-text (e.g., Whisper or similar), generative AI for personalized content and feedback, and curriculum logic that adapts to each learner's progress.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Auth & DB: Supabase (Auth + Postgres)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Key libs: @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-ui-react, lucide-react

## Repository layout (important files)

Note: this list covers files relevant to auth, enrollment and speech processing (the current working area).

## Data model (inferred)

- Table: `profiles`
  - `id` (uuid) — user's Supabase id
  - `name` (string)
  - `email` (string)
  - `level` (string: beginner|intermediate|advanced)
  - `goals` (array or json)
- `curricula` — Stores course-level information.
- `lessons` — Stores individual lessons for each curriculum.
- `lesson_items` — Stores the specific content (e.g., phrases) for each lesson.
- `user_enrollments` — Links users to the curricula they are enrolled in.
- `user_lesson_progress` — Tracks a user's completion status and score for each lesson.


Adjust the actual Postgres types in Supabase if needed. The app reads/writes these fields via the Supabase client.

## Authentication & OAuth redirect notes

- The app uses Supabase Auth with Google as a provider via `@supabase/auth-ui-react`.
- The `Auth` component in `app/auth/page.tsx` sets `redirectTo` to `${window.location.origin}/auth` (local dev), but in production you must register the exact Vercel URL as an authorized redirect in both Supabase and the Google OAuth client.
- Current deployed site: https://kalima-five.vercel.app
- You indicated you've updated Supabase redirect URL to `https://kalima-five.vercel.app/enrollment`. That is valid — make sure the same URL is added as an Authorized Redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console for the OAuth Client ID.

Why this matters
- OAuth redirect URIs must match exactly. If a provider redirects to the wrong path (for example `/`), the token fragment may be lost from the page that expects it, and the client will not finish the sign-in flow.

## Key client/server flows

1. Sign-in flow
   - User visits `/auth` and uses Supabase Auth UI to sign in with Google.
   - After provider consent, Supabase/Google redirect back to a configured redirect URI with a session token (often returned in the URL fragment for implicit flow) or a code for PKCE flow.
   - Client calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` and subscribes to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` to detect the session and redirect the user accordingly.

2. Enrollment flow
   - Protected route `/enrollment` uses client-side `supabase.auth.getSession()` to ensure a session exists.
   - If no session, app redirects to `/auth`.
   - If session exists, the `Enrollment` component fetches the `profiles` row for the current user and populates the form.
   - User edits fields (name/email/level/goals) and submits. The client updates the `profiles` row and then routes to `/learn` with encoded lessons.

3. Speech processing (prototype)
   - `VoiceRecorder` uses Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) for live transcription and MediaRecorder to capture audio Blobs.
   - The API `app/api/speech/route.ts` currently simulates transcription (returns mocked transcribed text and pronunciation scoring). This is a placeholder for integration with an external Speech-to-Text service (OpenAI Whisper or similar).

Note: the long-term vision is to use speech transcription and generative models to run interactive voice agents (conversational tutors) that can produce dialogues, role-play scenarios, and adaptive exercises tailored to the user's level and goals.

4. Demo Flow
   - The demo route `/demo` provides an interactive experience with a mock AI agent
   - Uses the VoiceRecorder for voice input and maintains a conversation history
   - Makes API calls to `/api/demo/route.ts` which provides deterministic responses based on keywords
   - Simulates a multi-turn dialogue to demonstrate the voice agent concept

## Known issues and risks (current)

1. OAuth redirect mismatch — If provider redirects to root (/) with token fragment rather than the `redirectTo` path the app uses (e.g., `/enrollment`), the client may not detect the session. Fix: configure exact redirect URIs in Supabase and Google.

2. VoiceRecorder considerations (low risk, after refactor)
   - Monitor memory usage with long recordings (audioChunks in refs)
   - Consider adding a maximum recording duration limit
   - Add visual feedback for recording errors
   - Consider streaming audio for longer recordings

3. `app/api/speech/route.ts` (server) — validation and performance
   - Input validation for `formData` entries is weak. The code trusts casts like `formData.get('audio') as File` and `formData.get('expectedText') as string` without checks.
   - The mock transcription uses randomness; for testing a deterministic mode would be better.
   - When integrating a real STT provider, be careful with file size limits and streaming vs in-memory buffering.

4. Supabase env vars
   - `lib/supabase.ts` uses non-null assertions on NEXT_PUBLIC env vars. If missing in Vercel, the app may fail; ensure env vars are configured correctly in all environments (dev, preview, prod).

## Immediate recommended improvements (high value, low risk)

1. Documentation: add this `docs/PROJECT.md` (✅ done) and maintain changelog entries for each change.
2. Enrollment UX improvements:
   - Add saving state (disable submit while saving), success feedback and error handling.
   - Client-side validation: required fields, email format, trim input, prevent duplicate goals.
   - Allow removing goals (small UI addition).
3. VoiceRecorder refactor: (✅ done)
   - Move recorder/recognition and chunk buffer to refs (✅ completed)
   - Initialize SpeechRecognition and MediaRecorder in separate effects (✅ completed)
   - Ensure `onstop` creates Blob from ref-held chunks reliably (✅ completed)
4. API route hardening: (✅ done)
   - Validate FormData entries, type checks, 400 errors (✅ completed)
   - Add `mode` flag for mock/real STT (✅ completed)
5. Auth hardening:
   - Implement authorization-code+PKCE flow for better security
   - Update redirect handling for code flow
6. Demo improvements:
   - Add more conversation scenarios
   - Improve error recovery in voice recording
   - Add loading states and transitions
   - Track demo engagement metrics
7. Landing page repositioning (marketing + UX)
    - Goal: reposition the landing page copy and visual emphasis away from a pronunciation-only message toward a holistic, confidence-first spoken-Arabic learning platform powered by AI voice agents.
    - Key messages to highlight on the landing page:
       - "Speak Arabic with confidence — practice anytime with AI voice agents."
       - "Personalized, voice-first lessons that adapt to your level and goals."
       - "Role-play real conversations, get instant feedback, and build fluent speaking habits."
    - Primary CTAs:
       - "Try the AI Agent" (opens an interactive demo where users can speak with an AI agent)
       - "Start Learning" (sign-up / enrollment)
    - Feature tiles to replace or reword existing ones:
       - AI Voice Agents — interactive conversation partners and tutors
       - Conversation-first curriculum — practical phrases and dialogues for daily life
       - Personalized Pathways — lessons adapt to your strengths and weaknesses
       - Multiple Dialects & Real-world Speech — exposure to MSA and regional variants
       - Progress & Confidence Tracking — metrics that show speaking improvements
    - Visual / UX suggestions:
       - Replace hero copy from "Master Arabic Speaking" / "AI-Powered Pronunciation" to confidence-focused statements above.
       - Replace static pronunciation-focused demo button with a "Try AI Agent" flow that simulates a short role-play (2–3 turns) using the existing `VoiceRecorder` and `app/api/speech/route.ts` (mock mode can simulate agent responses).
       - Use user-friendly visuals (people speaking, conversational bubbles, microphone iconography). Keep Arabic typography accents but emphasize human conversation.
    - Implementation steps (concrete files to change):
       - `components/landing-page.tsx` — update hero copy, features array, and CTA handlers.
       - `components/audio/VoiceRecorder.tsx` — ensure the demo mode can be used by the hero "Try AI Agent" CTA (expose a callback to start a short interactive demo).
       - `app/page.tsx` — ensure it routes to updated landing page component (already imports it).
       - Optionally add a lightweight demo route `/demo` that runs a short AI-agent conversation using mock responses from the existing `app/api/speech/route.ts`.
    - Example hero copy (pick one):
       - "Speak Arabic with confidence. Practice with AI voice agents anytime, anywhere."
       - Subheading: "Personalized voice-first lessons and conversation partners to help you speak naturally." 
    - Quick A/B friendly variant for CTA text:
       - Variant A: Primary CTA — "Try the AI Agent"; Secondary CTA — "Start Learning"
       - Variant B: Primary CTA — "Start Speaking"; Secondary CTA — "Try Demo"

    - Measurement: track clicks on the demo CTA and sign-ups from the hero. Monitor engagement of the demo flow to iterate on messaging.

## Changelog (versioned entries)

Use this area to record every change to the project with date and version. Add a new entry for each pull request / change you make.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.22 — Fix: Resolve build error from explicit 'any' type
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: The build was failing due to a linting error that disallowed the use of the `any` type for the `session` parameter in the `onAuthStateChange` handler.
  - Notes: Replaced the `any` type with the correct `Session | null` type from `@supabase/supabase-js`.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.21 — Fix: Resolve auth page redirect loop
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: Users were getting stuck on the auth page with a flickering screen due to a redirect loop caused by the `onAuthStateChange` listener re-running on every render.
  - Notes: Wrapped the `onAuthStateChange` callback in `useCallback` to stabilize the function and prevent the `useEffect` hook from re-subscribing on every render, thus breaking the infinite loop.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.20 — Fix: Correct OAuth redirect handling
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: Users were getting stuck on the root page after OAuth login because the redirect URL was incorrect. The client-side code to handle the session token was not being executed.
  - Notes: Re-added the `redirectTo` prop to the Supabase `Auth` component, ensuring users are always redirected back to the `/auth` page to complete the sign-in flow.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.19 — Fix: Resolve authentication redirect race condition for existing users
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: Existing users were getting stuck on the auth page due to a race condition between the Supabase `Auth` component's default redirect and the custom `onAuthStateChange` redirect logic.
  - Notes: Removed the `redirectTo` prop from the `Auth` component to prevent it from initiating its own navigation, allowing the `onAuthStateChange` handler to reliably control the post-login redirect.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.18 — Fix: Resolve authentication redirect race condition
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: Existing users were getting stuck on the auth page due to a race condition between `getSession()` and `onAuthStateChange` both trying to redirect simultaneously.
  - Notes: Removed the redundant `checkSession` call inside `useEffect`. The `onAuthStateChange` listener is sufficient to handle both initial session checks and subsequent auth events, eliminating the race condition.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.17 — Fix: Improve new user login flow
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: The auth page was treating a "profile not found" error as a fatal error, preventing new users from being redirected to the enrollment page.
  - Notes: The logic now correctly identifies the Supabase error code for a missing profile (`PGRST116`) and redirects new users to `/enrollment` as intended.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.16 — Fix: Handle new user login flow
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: New users were getting stuck on the auth page because the code did not handle cases where a user profile does not exist yet.
  - Notes: Added a null check for the user profile. If no profile exists, the user is correctly redirected to the `/enrollment` page.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.15 — Refactor: Convert Curricula Page to Server Component
  - Files changed: `app/curricula/page.tsx`, `app/curricula/CurriculaClient.tsx` (new)
  - Reason: To improve initial page load performance by fetching all curricula data on the server.
  - Notes: The curricula page is now an `async` Server Component. Data fetching for curricula and user enrollments happens on the server. The interactive UI (search, sort, filter) has been moved to a new `CurriculaClient.tsx` component.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.14 — Feature: Add Level Filter to Curricula Page
  - Files changed: `app/curricula/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To allow users to filter the list of available curricula by difficulty level.
  - Notes: Added "All", "Beginner", "Intermediate", and "Advanced" filter buttons that update the displayed list of courses.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.13 — Feature: Add Sorting to Curricula Page
  - Files changed: `app/curricula/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To improve usability by allowing users to sort the list of available curricula.
  - Notes: Added a dropdown to sort curricula by name (default) or by level (beginner to advanced).

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.12 — Feature: Add Search to Curricula Page
  - Files changed: `app/curricula/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To allow users to easily find specific curricula by searching for keywords in the title or description.
  - Notes: Added a search input field and client-side filtering logic to the "Available Curricula" page.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.11 — Refactor: Convert Dashboard to Server Component
  - Files changed: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx` (new)
  - Reason: To improve initial page load performance by fetching all dashboard data on the server.
  - Notes: The dashboard page is now an `async` Server Component. All data fetching (`get_user_dashboard_data`, `get_user_activity_stats`, etc.) happens on the server. The interactive UI has been moved to a new `DashboardClient.tsx` component, which receives the data as props. This eliminates the client-side loading state.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.10 — Feature: Add Activity Streak and Recent Lessons to Dashboard
  - Files changed: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, Database (new RPC function `get_user_activity_stats`)
  - Reason: To increase user engagement and provide a more dynamic dashboard experience.
  - Notes: Added a new section to the dashboard displaying the user's consecutive day learning streak and their three most recently completed lessons. This required a new SQL function to calculate the stats efficiently.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.9 — Feature: Improve Curricula Page UX
  - Files changed: `app/curricula/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To provide clearer feedback to users by showing which curricula they are already enrolled in.
  - Notes: The "Start Learning" button is now replaced with an "Enrolled (Go to Dashboard)" button for curricula the user has already joined.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.8 — Content: Added 9 new curricula and lessons
  - Files changed: N/A (Database content)
  - Reason: To significantly expand the learning content available to users, covering a wide range of conversational topics.
  - Notes: Added curricula for "Restaurant & Cafe Conversations", "Daily Routines", "Shopping", "Family", "Travel", "Health", "Work", "Hobbies", and "Food".

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.7 — Fix: Resolved build failure from implicit 'any' type
  - Files changed: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Reason: The build was failing due to a TypeScript error where a parameter in a `.map()` call had an implicit `any` type.
  - Notes: Explicitly typed the parameter to resolve the error, ensuring a successful production build.

### Unreleased
- 2025-10-14 v0.4.6 — Feature: Enhanced User Dashboard

### Unreleased
- 2025-10-14 v0.4.6 — Feature: Enhanced User Dashboard
  - Files changed: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To improve the user experience by making the dashboard more professional, personalized, and intuitive.
  - Notes:
    - Added a personalized welcome message for the user.
    - Implemented a skeleton loading state for a smoother UI.
    - Updated curriculum cards to show the title of the next lesson, providing clearer context.
    - Added a "Completed! 🎉" state for finished curricula.
    - Improved overall layout with a main header and a clear call-to-action to browse new curricula.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.5 — Fix: Corrected post-authentication redirect flow
  - Files changed: `app/auth/page.tsx`
  - Reason: Users with existing profiles were being incorrectly redirected to `/learn` without context, causing an error.
  - Notes: The redirect is now correctly pointed to `/dashboard`, which is the intended landing page for enrolled users.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.4 — Refactor: Implemented lazy initialization for OpenAI client
  - Files changed: `lib/ai/openai.ts`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Reason: To fix a build-time error where `OPENAI_API_KEY` was required during `next build`.
  - Notes: The OpenAI client is now initialized only when an API call is made, not at module load time. This is a more robust pattern.

- 2025-10-14 v0.4.3 — Fix: Resolved build failure from syntax error
  - Files changed: `lib/ai/agent.ts`
  - Reason: A duplicated code block at the end of the file was causing a syntax error.
  - Notes: Removed the duplicated code to allow the build to succeed.

### Unreleased
- 2025-10-14 v0.4.2 — Refactor: Improve Type Safety and Error Handling in AI Agent and API
  - Files changed: `lib/ai/agent.ts`, `app/api/agent/route.ts`
  - Reason: To improve the robustness and reliability of the AI agent and its corresponding API route.
  - Notes:
    - Fixed several bugs in `agent.ts` related to incorrect property access and asynchronous operations.
    - Hardened the `agent` API route by adding input validation and safer type handling for form data.
    - Removed unused imports and improved code quality.

If you'd like, I can now:
1. Implement the immediate Enrollment improvements (saving state, validation, delete goal) and add changelog entry; or
2. First refactor `VoiceRecorder` (higher technical risk but important); or
3. Add server-side validation to `app/api/speech/route.ts`.

Tell me which item to do next and I'll make the code change and add a versioned changelog entry here.
